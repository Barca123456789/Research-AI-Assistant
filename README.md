## ðŸ”„ Process Workflow

### 1. Topic Input
The user enters a topic (e.g., "Artificial Intelligence").

### 2. Prompt Engineering
A dynamic and advanced prompt is generated, instructing the LLM to create:
- 6â€“7 sections (200â€“250 words each)
- Statistics and citations
- 5â€“7 academic references
- 3â€“4 learning resources

### 3. LLM Integration via Groq API
- Uses `llama3-70b-8192` model via **Groq API** for fast, high-quality response
- Sends the prompt using `requests` with your Groq API key

### 4. Response Handling
- The modelâ€™s response is parsed and formatted
- Sections are separated and titles identified

### 5. Report Display in Streamlit
- Streamlit dynamically displays the output with proper formatting
- Includes expanders, scrollable containers, and optional charts

### 6. (Optional) Future Export
- Plans to add PDF/Markdown export of the report  
- Integration of real-time web scraping and citation validation is in the roadmap
